# Accessibility

FinbloxUI Components follow the WAI-ARIA authoring practices guidelines and are tested in a wide selection of modern
browsers and commonly used assistive technologies. We take care of many of the difficult implementation details related 
to accessibility, including `aria` and `role` attributes, focus management, and keyboard navigation. That means that users 
should be able to use our components as-is in most contexts and rely on functionality to follow the expected accessibility design patterns.

## WAI-ARIA

[WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/), published and maintained by the W3C, specifies the semantics for many common UI patterns that 
show up in FinbloxUI Components. This is designed to provide meaning for controls that aren't built using elements provided by the browser.
For example, if you use a `div` instead of a `button` element to create a button, there are attributes you need to add to the `div` in order to convey 
that it's a `button` for screen readers or voice recognition tools.

In addition to semantics, there are behaviors that are expected from different types of components. A `button` element is going to respond to 
certain interactions in ways that a `div` will not, so it's up to the developer to reimplement those interactions with JavaScript. 
The WAI-ARIA authoring practices provide additional guidance for implementing behaviors for various controls that come with FinbloxUI Components.

## Accessible Labels

With many built-in form controls, the native HTML `label` element is designed to provide semantic meaning and context for corresponding `input` elements. 
For non-form control elements, or for custom controls like those provided by FinbloxUI Components, [WAI-ARIA provides a specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.2/#namecalculation) for how to provide 
accessible names and descriptions to those contols.

Where possible, FinbloxUI Components include abstractions to make labelling our controls simple. The `Label` component is designed to work with many of 
our controls. Ultimately it's up to you to provide those labels so that users have the proper context when navigating your application.

## Keyboard Navigation

Many complex components, like Tabs and Dialog, come with expectations from users on how to interact with their content using a keyboard or other 
non-mouse input modalities. FinbloxUI Components provide basic keyboard support in accordance with the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.2/).

## Focus Management

Proper keyboard navigation and good labelling often go hand-in-hand with managing focus. When a user interacts with an element and something changes 
as a result, it's often helpful to move focus with the interaction so that the next tab stop is logical depending on the new context of the app. 
And for screen reader users, moving focus often results in an announcement to convey this new context, which relies on proper labelling.

In many FinbloxUI Components, we move focus based on the interactions a user normally takes in a given component. For example, in `AlertDialog`, when the 
modal is opened, focus is programatically moved to a Cancel button element to anticipate a response to the prompt.

## Why Do Components Have an `as` Prop?

FinbloxUI Components all render their root HTML element with an HTML primitive tag. For example, a link based component may render default root element
as an HTML anchor `a` tag. However, for your purpose you may need it be a `button` element. The `as` prop allows you to instruct the component to render
the root element as a `button`. For example, `<ComponentName as="button" />`. Many components utilize HTML heading tags as their root. Depending on how
you place these components this may confuse a screen reader. You can change the heading element using the `as` prop.
