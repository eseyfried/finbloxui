# Events

FinbloxUI components emit events based on user interactions (i.e. click events). As an application developer, you may capture and handle these events
as you deem appropriate for your use cases. FinbloxUI follows the standard Vue 3 method for event binding.


## Binding Event Handlers to Components

All components that emit events include documentation listing the events and event data they transmit. Events follow a simple naming convention that
includes the name of the component emitting the event. For example, a component named `ComponentName` will have events prefixed with `fb-component-name-*`.

Here is an example of a component with 3 events bound to event handlers:

<code>

``` html
<ComponentName
    v-bind="args"
    @fb-component-name-action-link:click="handleActionClick"
    @fb-component-name-email-link:click="handleEmailClick"
    @fb-component-name-phone-link:click="handlePhoneClick"
/>
```

</code>

## Writing Event Handlers

Event handlers are nothing more than basic javascript functions that take a single argument. The argument is the event data passed by the emitted event.
Components document the event data passed to callbacks. You must load your callbacks such that your placed components have access to the functions.

<code>

``` javascript
const handleActionClick = (event) => {
    console.log(event);
}

const handleEmailClick = (event) => {
    console.log(event);
}

const handlePhoneClick = (event) => {
    console.log(event);
}
```

</code>
